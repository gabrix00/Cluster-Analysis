# University Admission

Nowadays the subject of __University Admissions__ is always much discussed, for this reason I realized this project based on __Clustering Analysis__ which tries to: 

1. Understand what are the scores of the students which have the probability to be admitted greater than the mean.
2. Understand what are the caratteristics of who is recognized as outlier.
3. Understand which is the best cluster algorithm and the optimal number of clusters. 
4. Understand which is the best cluster algorithm in terms of misclassifications.
5. Understand if the dummy variable 'Research' has a real impact on the probability of Admission.
